# Quadtree

* Quadtree is a Data structure used to do binary-search sort of behaviour in 2D space. 
* Just like binary search on 1D can be represented as a Binary Search Tree, search in 2D can be represented as a quadtree.
* Useful to find the nearest cab, restaurants, delivery partners etc.

# How it works ?
* Assume a 2D space and one point (lets say user using the app), represented as .
* We want to find the nearest cab or delivery partner from the user.
* We will create a 2D search space for all the available resources (like cab, or partner), represented as a list.
