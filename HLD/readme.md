# High level System Design

## Blueprint for the requirements:
We can divide the requirements into these categories:
1. Functional requirements: They are the basic features needed in order to build the system. You cannot design your system without these.
2. Non functional requirements: These are good to have features. They will add value and enhance user experience but are not essential for feature development.
3. Future scope: Requirements that we are not trying to cater to in the system design but can be part of the system in near future.
