# High level System Design

## Blueprint for the requirements:
We can divide the requirements into these categories:
1. Functional requirements: They are the basic features needed in order to build the system. You cannot design your system without these.
2. Non functional requirements: These are good to have features. They will add value and enhance user experience but are not essential for feature development. These are mostly general properties of system like high availabilty, fault tolerant etc.
3. Future scope: Requirements that we are not trying to cater to in the system design but can be part of the system in near future.
4. Capacity Estimation: These are mainly requirements in terms of no of users, watch time per user, response time, latency allowed, bandwidth needed, storage needed etc.
