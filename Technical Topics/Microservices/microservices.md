### Microservices

Microservice is a small, autonomous subsystem that is designed and build to serve a singular use case.
For instance, in a app like Zomato, there can be ordering service, delivery service etc.
Each microservices has an individual set of responsibilities and they complete it efficiently and correctly.

Core Idea: Divide the task into subtask and conquer them individually to get your task done.
