# Fcatory Design Strategy
In facroty design, we need to design and implemement the logic in such a way that the scalability and extensibility is encapsulated in a single function so that the client using that class doesnt have to be bothered in case more objects and classes are added.
This is useful in the case where the changes in one code piece forces other to change their pattern as well.
